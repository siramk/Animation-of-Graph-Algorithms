There is already one default graph, but if user want to give a new graph then user should follow the below steps:

The user should mention the following things in the input.txt file available in the current directory.
1.)no.of vertices
2.)adjacency matrix with cost of edges


and then run the program with pyhton3 min_span_tree.py

NOTE: A default graph is already placed in input_mst.txt

Example of input:
5         --------->no.of vertices
0 2 7 0 0
2 0 3 8 5
7 3 0 1 0 --------->adjacency matrix
0 8 1 0 4
0 5 0 4 0
